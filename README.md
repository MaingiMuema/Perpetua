## **API Integration**
Perpetua uses the Hyperbolic API with DeepSeek-V3 model to power the AI dialogue. Below is an example of how the API is integrated:

```typescript
const response = await axios.post(
  'https://api.hyperbolic.xyz/v1/chat/completions',
  {
    model: 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: 'You are an AI engaging in a philosophical dialogue.'
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'What is the meaning of life?'
      }
    ],
    max_tokens: 512,
    temperature: 0.1,
    top_p: 0.9
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer [API_KEY]',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);
```

### **API Configuration**
- **Model:** `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3`
- **Max Tokens:** 512 (controls response length)
- **Temperature:** 0.1 (controls creativity; lower values make responses more focused)
- **Top_p:** 0.9 (controls diversity; higher values allow for more varied responses)
